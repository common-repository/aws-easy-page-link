Using the External Link List feature of TinyMCE, this makes it easy to create a link to another page on your website.

== Description ==

TinyMCE has a built in feature to include a predefined list of links to select from. This plugin simply creates a list
from your pages in WordPress. Create a link like usual in TinyMCE, but you now have a new drop down menu called "Link List"
where all pages/links are already setup for you.

This currently only works for pages, not for posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `AWS-easy-page-link` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it :)
